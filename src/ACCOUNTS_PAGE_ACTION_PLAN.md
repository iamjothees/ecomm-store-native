1.  **Create the Main Accounts Page:**
    *   Create a new file at `src/screens/Account.jsx` which will serve as the main page for user accounts.
    *   This page will be structured to host various account-related sections.

2.  **Set Up Routing:**
    *   Add a new route for `/account` in `src/AppRouter.jsx`.
    *   This route will be protected to ensure that only authenticated users can access their account page.

3.  **Develop Account Sections as Components:**
    I will create the following reusable components for the different sections of the accounts page:
    *   **`ProfileSection.jsx`**: Displays the user's profile information (name, email, etc.) with an option to edit.
    *   **`OrderHistory.jsx`**: Lists the user's past orders with links to view order details.
    *   **`ManageAddresses.jsx`**: Allows the user to view, add, edit, and delete their saved shipping addresses.

4.  **Build the User Interface:**
    *   Use your existing Shadcn UI components to build a clean and consistent user interface for the accounts page and its sections.
    *   The layout will be designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate on both mobile and desktop.

5.  **Integrate Backend Services:**
    *   Connect the new components to your existing services (`userService`, `orderService`, `authService`) to fetch and manage user data, orders, and addresses.
    *   Implement the logout functionality.

6.  **Assemble the Page:**
    *   Finally, I will assemble all the sections into the main `Account.jsx` page to create a complete and functional accounts page.
